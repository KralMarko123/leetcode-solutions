export const BEST_TIME_TO_BUY_AND_SELL_STOCK_DESCRIPTION = `You are given an array prices where price[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith i. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single i to buy one stock and choosing a different i in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0`;

export const BINARY_SEARCH_DESCRIPTION = `Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1. You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.`;

export const ARITHMETIC_PROGRESSION_DESCRIPTION = `A sequence of numbers is called an arithmetic progression if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same. Given an array of numbers arr, return true if the array can be rearranged to form an arithmetic progression. Otherwise, return false.`;

export const LONGEST_CONSECUTIVE_SEQUENCE_DESCRIPTION = `Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence. You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.`;

export const MIN_STACK_DESCRIPTION = `Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time. Implement the MinStack class:\n\nMinStack() initializes the stack object.\nvoid push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.\nvoid pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.\nint top() gets the top element of the stack.\nint getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.\n\nYou must implement a solution with O(1) time complexity for each function.`;

export const CAN_PLACE_FLOWERS_DESCRIPTION = `You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots. Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.`;

export const CONTAINS_DUPLICATE_DESCRIPTION = `Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.`;

export const CONTAINS_DUPLICATE_TWO_DESCRIPTION = `Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] == nums[j] and abs(i - j) <= k.`;
